# EmployeerackerProgram

 This program gets opens a file named "Employee.txt", and sends it to a function in the 
 FileIO class(header file included) to read its contents into an array of dynamically allocated
 pointers to Employee objects(header file included).

 It then prints a menu and gives the user the choice of whether to add to, remove from, look up 
 from, sort alphabetically and display, or save the information of the employees to "Employee.txt"

 The program will then print the menu again and allow the user to access the data another
 way. It will keep repeating until the user enters a 5 as a menu selection, at which point
 it will save the information of the employees to "Employee.txt".
